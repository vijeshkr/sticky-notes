# Sticky Notes App

**Sticky Notes** is a web-based application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. Each note is automatically assigned a random pastel color, and all notes are stored locally in the browser for persistent access.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Add new sticky notes with a click of the button.
- **Edit Notes**: Update your notes, and they automatically save.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove any note with a built-in delete button.
- **Random Colors**: Each note gets a unique pastel color.
- **Persistent Storage**: Your notes are stored in local storage, so they remain even after refreshing the browser.
